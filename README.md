 ## What it does
 Studify is an AI-powered study assistant that turns your notes, lectures, and problem sets into actionable learning tools in seconds. By uploading your study materials, the tool provides human-like, personalized explanations that adapt to your individual learning style. Whether it's breaking down complex concepts, offering simplified explanations, or guiding you through practice problems, Studify helps students optimize their study sessions and improve retention.

## How we built it
I leveraged large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create a tool that could analyze and understand users' own learning materials in combination with trillions of data points on the internet. The AI is trained to identify the most relevant learning materials —whether it's lecture notes, problem sets, or textbooks — and generate explanations that are concise, relevant, and tailored to the user's needs.
